# RStudio-Twitter-Project
Data Mining project pulling and organizing tweets using RStudio.
This project was from my Senior year Data Mining for Business Applications Course.
The project was designed to pull hundreds of tweets from Twitter based on specific variables such as keywords or hashtags.
The tweets were then cleaned and organized and uploaded into an excel file showing all of the tweets and their specific data, including geolocation and when the tweets were created.
The code also creates multiple wordpress tables and graphs to visualize the data.
